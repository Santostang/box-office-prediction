Today, people tend to read movie reviews on the websites like Rotten Tomatoes to decide whether one movie is worth going to watch or not. Most likely, the online reviews, especially those coming out during the first week, would influence the box office performances a lot. As the reviews from the first week are the earliest and freshest, we can expect that each of them has effect on the decisions of potential audiences. 

For the project, we would like to take the basic profile of one movie (i.e. category, studio brand, budget, celebrity effect), along with its first week’s online reviews (i.e. from professional critics and audiences), to construct a model to predict the box office of it.
